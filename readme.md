# Motivation
Why make this when there are so many other libraries that promise to do the same?

There were multiple reasons I decided to embark on this project, some of them being
<br>
#### Bloat
In many of the other libraries like this, I've found that they nearly always require Boost (Massive), 
or some other random library that hasn't been used / maintained since 2008. Which makes the process of actually going and using the replacement
very troublesome. 
<br>
#### Learning
As it stands, I have a lot to learn in C++. And I believe doing this will allow me to learn a lot
so I'm going to go ahead and do it. 

# Contribute

# Benchmarks
There's a lot of talk about numbers and performance when talking about this library compared to others.
But how does it compare to other similar libraries?
